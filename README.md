Code snippets for vector graphics drawing in Photoshop

## Scripts
This collection of scripts for Adobe Photoshop were collected during a deep-dive for a graphics rendering project. 

While After Effects and Illustrator can be controlled using a fairly broad and robust DOM API documented here https://ae-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/ and here https://ai-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/ the Photoshop equivalent proved itself to be both sparse and limited, see here https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/photoshop/using/scripting

Instead, a secondary API, originally created to add the Actions functionality to PS, can be used for programmatic control of Photoshop, however it remains officially undocumented and considerably more complicated to use. 

The best resource I could find to help learn this ActionManager API was this Chinese language blog https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/601014597 which proved invaluable. It was then possible to modify and build upon snippets posted publicly on forums to complete my scripting needs.
